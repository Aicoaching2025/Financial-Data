# KMeans Clustering for Financial Data Segmentation

## 📊 **Project Overview**
This project applies **unsupervised learning** using **KMeans clustering** to segment customers based on financial behavior. By analyzing features like annual income, spending habits, and credit scores, we can identify distinct customer groups, enabling financial institutions to tailor their products more effectively.

## 📝 **Problem Statement**
Financial institutions need to segment their customer base to improve marketing strategies and product offerings. By clustering customers into groups with similar financial behaviors, banks and financial service providers can:
- Offer personalized credit cards or loan options.
- Target high-spending, high-income groups with premium services.
- Identify low-risk and high-risk customer segments.

## 🚀 **Goals**
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand customer financial behavior.
- Use **KMeans clustering** to segment customers into distinct groups.
- Visualize and interpret the clusters for actionable business insights.

## 🔍 **Technologies Used**
- Python 3.x  
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`  
- Clustering Algorithm: **KMeans** from `scikit-learn`

## 🗂️ **Dataset Description**
The generated synthetic dataset contains the following features:
- **Annual Income (k$):** Income range from 20k to 150k.
- **Spending Score (1-100):** Indicator of spending behavior.
- **Credit Score (300-850):** Customer's creditworthiness.
- **Cluster:** Assigned customer segment from KMeans clustering.

## 🛠️ **Installation & Setup**
1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/kmeans-finance-segmentation.git
cd kmeans-finance-segmentation
```
2. **Create a virtual environment (optional):**
```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # For Unix/macOS
# or
env\Scripts\activate    # For Windows
```
3. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. **Run the analysis notebook:**
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/kmeans_clustering_analysis.ipynb
```

## 🧮 **Methods & Steps**
### 1. **Data Generation & Exploration**
- Generate synthetic financial data (income, spending, credit score).
- Visualize relationships between features using scatter plots and pairplots.

### 2. **Preprocessing**
- Scale features using `StandardScaler` for fair distance measurements.
- Check for outliers and handle missing values if needed.

### 3. **Choosing Optimal Clusters**
- **Elbow Method:** Analyze WCSS to determine the appropriate number of clusters.
- **Silhouette Score:** Evaluate cluster quality.

### 4. **Modeling with KMeans**
- Train KMeans with the selected number of clusters.
- Assign cluster labels to the dataset.

### 5. **Visualization & Interpretation**
- Plot clusters with different colors to understand segmentation.
- Analyze cluster centers to describe typical customer profiles.

### 6. **Results & Business Insights**
| Cluster | Annual Income (k$) | Spending Score | Credit Score | Description |
|---------|-------------------|----------------|--------------|-------------|
| 0       | 120k               | 80             | 750          | High-income, high-spenders |
| 1       | 60k                | 40             | 650          | Middle-income, moderate spenders |
| 2       | 30k                | 70             | 600          | Low-income, high spenders |
| 3       | 80k                | 20             | 700          | High-income, low spenders |
